# Sync.me
Sync.me builds customised Spotify playlists with up to 30 tracks that are appropriate for the user's current mood. As viable music for the playlist, it takes the 500 most recent tunes saved to a user's profile. The user's mood can be determined by taking a picture of their face and reading their emotions, or by manually inputting a mood.
